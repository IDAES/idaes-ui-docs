# PARETO UI

Run and modify optimization analyses of produced water networks created under the PARETO project.

<!--

Organizations need advanced  _decision support_  solutions for the disposition of produced water from onshore oil & gas operations — which are intuitive and accessible to field and system engineers.

* Goals: Intuitive and accessible to Pyomo optimization models for oil & gas produced water.
* Major Features:
  - Adaptable to a wide variety of technologies and geographies
  - Future integrations with subsurface modeling\, orphan wells plugging optimization\, and other related solutions
  - Cross-platform graphical UI for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, with one-click install
  - Table-based inputs, editable in Excel or in the tool\, specifying water source/sink/etc.   details
- Optimization step with "override" to take advantage of field operator knowledge
